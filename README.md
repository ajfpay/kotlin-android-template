## Project Structure

The project includes three sub-projects, each in their own subdirectories:

- **`app`:** The source for the final Android application.
- **`library-android`:** The source for an Android library including UI.
- **`library-kotlin`:** The source for a UI-less Kotlin library.
- **`library-compose`:** The source for a UI library with Jetpack Compose library.

The following additional top-level directories configure & support building the app & projects:

- **`buildSrc`:** Contains shared Gradle logic as [precompiled script plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html#sec:precompiled_plugins)
- **`config`:** Contains the [Detekt configuration file](https://detekt.dev/docs/introduction/configurations/).
- **`gradle`:** Contains Gradle Configuration files such as the Gradle Version Catalog and the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

Finally, the following hidden top-level directories provide functionality for specific development systems:

- **`.github`:** Defines the [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI tasks and templates for new pull requests, issues, etc.
- **`.idea`:** Sets common initial project settings when the project is opened in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
